# Task 1: Communication models and Middleware

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Is requiered a configuration file (in .yaml format) located in the root direcory of the project, and named ibm_cloud_config in order to have access to those services.
ibm_cloud_config follows the following format:

```
ibm_cf:
    endpoint    : CF_API_ENDPOINT
    namespace   : CF_HOST
    api_key     : CF_API_KEY
    bucket      : Bucket

ibm_cos:
    endpoint   : COS_API_ENDPOINT
    access_key : ACCESS_KEY
    secret_key : SECRET_KEY

rabbitmq:
    url         : URL
```

yaml is necessary to read the configuration file, and it can be intalled like this:

```
sudo pip install pyyaml
```


### Installing

To run the code is necessary to have some functions on the cloud, they can be created with the  createFunctions.py code

```
python3 createFunctions.py
```
## Running the program

The program can be executed with the following command:

```
python3 orchestrator textFile numberWorkers
```

## Test


* **textFile** as the name of the file the program is going to analyse
* **numberWorkers** as the number of paralel functions the program is going to call<br><br>
for example the following command would analyse the pg2000.txt file with 10 workers
```
python3 orchestrator.py pg2000.txt 10
```
